# Snowman Defender
Save the snowpeople from the robot hoards by collecting each one without touching the robots. Use your WASD keys to collect the snowpeople, but watch out for the robots! This game is timed and tracks your score. Good luck!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development, testing, or entertainment purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install the following software/modules: 

``pip``

``Pygame``

``Python 2 or Python 3``

``snowman_pygame``

### Installing

Make sure you have `pip` installed on your local machine. [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ships with pip, check if you have pip installed using ``python -m pip --version`` on the CLI. Otherwise, to install pip, see the [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). 
 
 ```
 python -m pip install -e https://github.com/ZATGit/Snowman-Defender-Pygame
 ```
 
 or
 
 ```
cd path/to/chosen/folder
git clone https://github.com/ZATGit/Snowman-Defender-Pygame
```
Alternatively, you can download a `.exe` [file](https://github.com/ZATGit/Snowman-Defender-Pygame/blob/master/snowman_pygame/dist/snowman_brick_collector/snowman_brick_collector.exe)

Don't forget to activate your virtual environment if you use one!
